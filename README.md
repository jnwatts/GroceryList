# GroceryList
A very simple grocery and/or scratch list app for Android.

When I got my first Android device I was dismayed that I couldn't find truely simple way to just jot down a couple things and then mark them completed. Everything I found was either laden with ads, needed to be categorized in to some database, or was implemented with unecessary graphical effects.

This application *just* stores a single list of items and allows you to check them off. You can remove individual items, all checked items, or completely empty the list. That's *ALL*. Enjoy! :-)
